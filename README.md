# Study Data Science Projects
Here's a few mini-projects for representation my skills and knowledges in different realms of Data Science:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Exploration
- Machine Learning

## Data Cleaning
Here's I'm preparing datasets for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted.

## Data Exploration
Here's I'm exploring datasets in an unstructured way to uncover initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest.

## Machine Learning
Here's I'm estimating the continuous or categorical outcome and using machine learning models.
